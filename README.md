# 1. New Developer Resources
  
A quick, one-stop-shop covering resources that may be useful for new developers (#OpinionsAreMyOwn).

These may be useful whether you are building a career in software development or are just looking for good resources to strengthen/sharpen existing skills.

## 1.1. Introduction

I've split the information into helpful resources for frontend/backend development. In addition, sections have been added to steer you towards good resources for practices and patterns that may aid you regardless of which flavour of software development you opt for.

Lastly, I don't think a guide such as this would be complete without some short lists on blogs to follow or interesting YouTube channels/Twitter feeds to keep an eye on.

## 1.2. Frontend

For the absolute basics of HTML & CSS, when starting out, I found this particular book incredible helpful and would recommend it thoroughly. Even for more experienced developers you may find the an odd piece of new information in here (one demerit is that looks as if there hasn't been a new addition for quite a while): [HTML&CSS (Jon Duckett)](https://www.htmlandcssbook.com/).

For JavaScript/TypeScript, I would recommend any courses on [udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/) by Stephen Grider or Jonas Schmedtmann. For example:

- [ES6 Javascript: The Complete Developer's Guide (Stephen Grider)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-es6-tutorial/).
- [Typescript: The Complete Developer's Guide (Stephen Grider)](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/).
- [The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert! (Jonas Schmedtmann)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).
- [Understanding TypeScript - 2022 Edition (Jonas Schmedtmann)](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/)

For CSS frameworks, having some understanding of Bootstrap will put you in good stead: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

I would also recommend checking out [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).

## 1.3. Backend

In an effort to keep this technology-agnostic (for now), one of the core things I can recommend is to hunt out some resources on SOLID design principles.

## 1.4. Practices & Patterns
