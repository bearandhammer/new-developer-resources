# 1. New Developer Resources
  
A quick, one-stop-shop covering resources that may be useful for new developers (#OpinionsAreMyOwn).

These may be useful whether you are building a career in software development or are just looking for good resources to strengthen/sharpen existing skills.

## 1.1. Introduction

I've split the information into helpful resources for frontend/backend development. In addition, sections have been added to steer you towards good resources for practices and patterns that may aid you regardless of which flavour of software development you opt for.

Lastly, I don't think a guide such as this would be complete without some short lists on blogs to follow or interesting YouTube channels/Twitter feeds to keep an eye on.
